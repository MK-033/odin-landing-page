# Odin's Aegis - Landing Page

A landing page project demonstrating foundational HTML and layout skills with Flexbox, built as part of The Odin Project's curriculumn.

## Project Overview

This project was an opportunity to practice creating a complete webpage from a design mockup. I chose to build upon the original design with a custom theme, 'Odin's Aegis,' to create a more engaging and unique final product.

## Core Skills Practiced

* Semantic HTML5 structure
* CSS styling and layout with Flexbox
* Working with buttons, navigation, and image assets
* Git/Github for version control and deployment
* Translating a design mockup into code

## What I Learned

This project was my first experience building a webpage from top to bottom. The most significant challenge was translating the two-dimensional layout of the 'Information' section into a flexible, one-dimensional Flexbox structure. This project solidified my understanding of:

* How to deconstruct a design  into logical HTML sections before writing any CSS.
* The power of using nested Flexbox containers to manage complex layouts.
* The importance of a clean, atomic Git workflow for tracking progress on a multi-stage project.
